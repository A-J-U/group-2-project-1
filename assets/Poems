Hohenzollern, I guess I shall work till I drop.\"\n\nAnd an English delegate thundered: -- \"The weak an' the lame be blowed!\nI've a berth in the Sou'-West workshops, a home in the Wandsworth Road;\nAnd till the 'sociation has footed my buryin' bill,\nI work for the kids an' the missus.  Pull up?  I be damned if I will!\"\n\nAnd over the German benches the bearded whisper ran: --\n\"Lager, der girls und der dollars, dey makes or dey breaks a man.\nIf Schmitt haf collared der dollars, he collars der girl deremit;\nBut if Schmitt bust in der pizness, we collars der girl from Schmitt.\"\n\nThey passed one resolution: -- \"Your sub-committee believe\nYou can lighten the curse of Adam when you've lightened the curse of Eve.\nBut till we are built like angels, with hammer and chisel and pen,\nWe will work for ourself and a woman, for ever and ever, amen.\"\n\nNow this is the tale of the Council the German Kaiser held --\nThe day that they razored the Grindstone, the day that the Cat was belled,\nThe day of the Figs from Thistles, the day of the Twisted Sands,\nThe day that the laugh of a maiden made light of the Lords of Their Hands.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/rudyard-kipling\/an-imperial-rescript","poet":{"name":"Rudyard Kipling","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/rudyard-kipling"}}]
